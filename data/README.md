Data Description
A large dataset of routinely acquired maternal-fetal screening ultrasound images collected from two different hospitals by several operators and ultrasound machines. All images were manually labeled by an expert maternal fetal clinician.
Images are divided into 6 classes: four of the most widely used fetal anatomical planes (Abdomen, Brain, Femur and Thorax), the mother’s cervix (widely used for prematurity screening) and a general category to include any other less common image plane. 
Fetal brain images are further categorized into the 3 most common fetal brain planes (Trans-thalamic, Trans-cerebellum, Trans-ventricular) to judge fine grain categorization performance. 
Meta information (patient number, us machine, operator) is also provided, as well as the training-test split used in the Nature Sci Rep paper.
