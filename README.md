Hybrid Quantum-Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial Attention for Accurate Classification of Maternal-Fetal Planes in Ultrasound Images

ABSTRACT 
Antenatal ultrasound (US) examination is the primary mode of assessment in fetal development and is considered completely safe for both the mother and the baby. However, ultrasound scans are subject to disturbances by various factors, which complicate the fetal biometry measurements and demand more of the examiner’s time. To enhance the diagnostic efficiency of fetal plane classification for detecting abnormalities and to optimize computational efficiency, a model utilizing quantum computation to accelerate processing speeds in a practical healthcare environment is proposed. A Hybrid Quantum-Convolutional Neural Network with Spatial Attention (HQ-CNN-SA) is developed for accurate classification of maternal-fetal planes in ultrasound images; it integrates quantum and classical convolution with attention techniques to classify fetal ultrasound images into six categories: maternal cervix, brain, abdomen, femur, thorax, and other. The parameterized quantum model leverages the properties of superposition and entanglement to achieve parallelism, processing information exponentially faster than its classical counterpart. Experimental findings indicate that the developed model significantly exceeds the performance of conventional CNNs and achieves an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 93%, and specificity of 99.2 %. Other performance metrics, such as Cohen’s kappa score and the Matthews correlation coefficient, are also computed to comprehensively evaluate the model’s performance.
